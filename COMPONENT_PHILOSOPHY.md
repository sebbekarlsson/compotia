# My philosophy of component development
> The philosophy of modular re-usable components.

> A component should:
* Be simple
* Do one thing
* Not have to much styling, this way it will be more modular and re-usable in
other projects.
* Preferably not have any dependencies

## Note
> These are just my thoughts of a perfect component, these are not rules.
